Structures of 53 commom alloy elements. File "elastic-reference.json" lists the elastic properties of these elements from experiment and by VASP.
The experimental values are from "Single Crystal Elastic Constants and Calculated Aggregate Properties. A Handbook".
The VASP values are calculated by VASP V5.4.4 with PBE functional and PAW potentials. The calculation details are in the file "INCAR".

The elastic calculated by ABACUS is in the file "elastic-abacus.json", and the calculation details are in the file "INPUT". The pseudo-potentials are from the APNS (https://kirk0830.github.io/ABACUS-Pseudopot-Nao-Square/pseudopotential/pseudopotential.html)
