Structures of 53 commom alloy elements. File "metrics_ref.json" lists the elastic properties of these elements from experiment and by VASP.
The experimental values are from "Single Crystal Elastic Constants and Calculated Aggregate Properties. A Handbook".
The VASP values are calculated by VASP V5.4.4 with PBE functional and PAW potentials. The calculation details are in the file "INCAR".
