    Profile name:
        - intel/gnu: intel or gnu compiler.
        - omp: calculation command is: OMP_NUM_THREADS=16 mpirun -np 1 abacus, and others are: OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 mpirun -np 16 abacus.
        - cg/dav: SCF calculation with cg or dav solver (PW basis set), and use <a href="https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/abacus-test.github.io/tree/master/datasets/dataset1-pw" target="detail">PW dataset</a>.
        - elpa/scalapack: SCF calculation with genelpa or scalapack_gvx (LCAO basis set), and use <a href="https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/abacus-test.github.io/tree/master/datasets/dataset2-lcao" target="detail">LCAO dataset</a>.
        - exx-test: testing on hybrid calculations, and use <a href="https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/abacus-test.github.io/tree/master/datasets/dataset3-exx" target="detail">EXX dataset</a>.
        - examples: testing on <a href="https://github.com/deepmodeling/abacus-develop/tree/develop/examples" target="detail">examples/</a> in ABACUS repository that containing allrun.sh script. 
    Metrics:
        - NormalEnd_ratio: the ratio of the example number with normal ending.
        - Converge_ratio: the ratio of the example number with SCF convergence.
        - SCFConverge Score: the reciprocal of the geometric mean of the SCF convergence steps for all examples, and takes 50 steps as 100 points. 
            The larger the value, the fewer steps required for convergence.
        - Performance Score: the reciprocal of the geometric mean of total time for all examples, and takes the result of abacus v3.0.0 as the baseline. 
            The larger the value, the less total time is consumed:
            - cg/dav takes the result of v3.0.0 intel-cg as 100 points.
            - genelpa/scalapack takes the result of v3.0.0 intel-elpa as 100 points.
        - "--" means that the metrics is not calculated.
    
    Value in the bracket is the percentage increase compared to the last result.
